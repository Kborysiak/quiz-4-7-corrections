# Quiz 4-7 Corrections
## Quiz 5
### Question 1)
For Question 1, I answered choice B, however, the correct answer was choice C. Choice C is the correct answer, as in order for the function to display which is the smallest choice of the three, an && statement is required so that both conditions will be met, and a will be true. The second line is also correct, as you need an || to make sure that c is not the smallest of the three, as if it is greater than one of the variables, it cannot be the smallest.
### Question 2)
For Question 2, I mistook the logical operators for the relational operators. The correct answers are all correct, as all of them are valid logical operators, whilst the answers that I chose were wrong as they were not valid logical operators.
### Question 4)
For Question 4, I mistook the relational operators for the logical operators. The correct answers are correct, as they are also valid relational operators, along with the other relational operators I entered.
### Question 6)
Along with the correct choice that I entered for this multiple select question, the fourth choice is also correct. This is because the first curly bracket does not have to be on the same line as the if statement is. It can look like this:
```
if(a<b)
{
  //do something
}
```
