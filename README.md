### Question 1)
For Question 1, I answered choice B, however, the correct answer was choice C. Choice C is the correct answer, as in order for the function to display which is the smallest choice of the three, an && statement is required so that both conditions will be met, and a will be true. The second line is also correct, as you need an || to make sure that c is not the smallest of the three, as if it is greater than one of the variables, it cannot be the smallest.
